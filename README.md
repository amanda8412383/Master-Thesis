#### Influence of Parental Earning on High School Dropout Probability during Covid-19 Pandemic

This repo contains my master thesis with the R code used.

The paper uses 2020â€™s Current Population Survey data from the US Census Bureau to inspect whether the low to none effect of parental earnings on high school dropout decisions of children found in previous studies alter after the global pandemic has taken effect. The result from both the GLM probit model and IV probit model suggests the relationship between parental earning remains unchanged during the early stage of pandemic. The irrelevancy also applies to racial minority groups and it stays true even if replacing earning by total parental income."# Master-Thesis"
